       "['After months of releasing preview images and several delays, Maserati has introduced the Grecale, its long-awaited entry-level SUV. The sub-Levante model is aimed directly at the Porsche Macan, and it will likely become the firm\\'s best-selling nameplate in the coming years.The latest addition to the Maserati range stretches 191 inches long and 66 inches tall, dimensions that make it about six inches shorter and nearly the same height as the Levante. Visually, it illustrates what Maserati design boss Klaus Busse meant when he told us that future Maserati models would borrow styling cues from the MC20: its front end is defined by a wide grille positioned below a pair of elongated headlights. Viewed from the side, the Grecale leans more toward sportiness than utility, while the back end wears horizontal lights connected by a strip of bright trim. Vents chiseled into the fenders and trident-shaped logos on the C-pillars link the SUV to the rest of the Maserati range. It\\'s a design that works, in our opinion: The Grecale is recognizable as a Maserati but not a copy of an existing model.Busse told us that the idea wasn\\'t merely to Xerox the MC20\\'s front end onto the body of an SUV.\"The design philosophy that I laid out in the beginning was actually done before we designed [the MC20 and the Grecale]. We really had to sit down and get our ahead around what we want to do with the next chapter of the brand. The reality is that 70% of the design process is understanding the message that you want to create, and the car then designs itself and the remaining 30% is just putting it on paper. We didn\\'t want to design the car purely for Instagram; end up with a car loaded with real or fake features, lines, and creases. We\\'re very much about purity. Maserati is a very strong performing car, so it doesn\\'t need to shout, \"Hey, look at me!\" Quite the opposite; it wants to be a rolling structure, a car that adds almost visual value to its environment. That\\'s the overreaching philosophy,\" Busse told Autoblog.Inside, Maserati integrated a relatively long list of tech features without making the dashboard look like the automotive equivalent of an iPhone. The driver faces up to four screens: a 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, a 12.3-inch touchscreen for the Maserati Intelligent Assistant (MIA) digital instrument cluster, an 8.8-inch touchscreen positioned right below, and a digital clock — yes, that seemingly counts as a screen. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility come standard, and the list of options includes a 21-speaker Sonus sound system.How the Grecale\\'s cabin is configured depends on the trim level selected. Buyers have several leather upholsteries and trim materials to choose from, including wood and carbon fiber. We\\'re guessing that the Fuoriserie program will provide additional customization options.\"It was time to up the game with our interior designs, but also with fit and finish and with technology,\" Busse said. \"Screens were never something that we were known for. And, to be honest, I don\\'t think that we want to be known for screens. Is the industry at peak screen? But, at the end of the day, we also want to reduce the amount of clutter in the car, so the result is what you see here,\" he added.At launch, the Grecale lineup will include three models called GT, Modena, and Trofeo, respectively. The first two trim levels are powered by a 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine turbocharged to 296 and 325 horsepower, respectively. It develops 332 pound-feet of torque regardless of horsepower. Linked to a 48-volt mild-hybrid system, the turbo-four spins the four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission.Enthusiasts will undoubtedly be more interested in the range-topping Trofeo. Instead of a four-cylinder engine, the flagship Grecale gains a version of the twin-turbocharged, 3.0-liter V6 called Nettuno and borrowed from the MC20 supercar. The six develops 523 horsepower and 457 pound-feet of torque in this application, and it also sends its power to the four wheels via an eight-speed automatic transmission. Brembo brakes help keep the extra power in check, and it sounds like they\\'re needed: Maserati pegs the Trofeo\\'s zero-to-60-mph time at 3.6 seconds and its top speed at 177 mph. An air suspension system comes standard on the Trofeo; it\\'s optional on the GT and on the Modena.Pricing for the 2023 Maserati Grecale GT starts at $64,995 including a mandatory $1,495 destination charge, while the Modena Limited Edition (which is only available online and for a short time) carries a base price of $78,895. There\\'s no word yet on how much the Trofeo will cost.Deliveries are scheduled to start in the fall 2022. Looking ahead, the Grecale range will grow with the addition of an electric model (shown in the gallery) that will wear the Folgore nameplate and that\\'s scheduled to reach showrooms before the end of 2023.What\\'s in a name?Historically, Maserati has named many of its cars after winds, and the Grecale is no exception. It borrows its name from a north-easterly Mediterranean wind that\\'s primarily felt on islands like Malta. Levante, Ghibli, Mistral, Bora, and Khamsin are wind names as well.Click to expand...2023 Maserati Grecale revealed with 523-hp twin-turbo V6 - AutoblogThe 2023 Maserati Grecale is positioned as a smaller alternative to the Levante.

The Sport setting leaves it in a higher gear than you’d normally choose, but it’s ready for the call.Will you notice the extra 30bhp of the Modena version? Probably not, but most folk will take it because more is more and the higher power doesn’t punish you too much at the pumps.The Trofeo is the diva of the range –expensive, the V6 lovely to listen to, technically accomplished\\u2009… and quite nice to hand back before you face the bills. And while it’s something of a dragster, when it comes to a corner, particularly a bumpy one, it reveals every single one of its extra 187kg over the weight of the Modena.Like all of these high-riding SUVs, the Grecale has to satisfy the need to ride gently while giving the impression of cornering like a sports car, and the result of this moderation is seldom completely satisfactory.With all-round independent suspension, Maserati has achieved a good compromise for the air-suspended cars, but a brilliant compromise for the standard steel suspension, which rides well, steers with precision and corners with lean but not sloppiness.The standard chassis feels well balanced and surprisingly comfortable compared with Porsche’s Macan. This new Maserati, entering one of the most heavily competitive classes of car, feels like one of those left-field choices that turns out to be a surprisingly sound one.You’ll have your own views on whether Maserati should be providing well-heeled families with SUVs such as this, but then you’d probably have to have the same opinion on Porsche and its equivalent as well.As it stands, the Grecale is good-looking, with a fine combination (for the class) of ride and handling, while the overall dynamics are impressive. But this is an expensive car – prohibitively so if you dig deep into the options list – and you can have a desirable Porsche Macan with a V6 engine for less whether you buy it outright or take a PCP finance deal.What’s more, as with any car, Maserati’s claims of great residual values (RV) are hot air until you sell your Grecale or realise the final value settlement after a three-year lease.

Some want to air their anger and attack the manufacturer etc. You also get the die hard that continue to bang their drum over and over again on every post and seem to have every issue possible, sometimes makes me wonder if their wheels even go round 😂 There are members that have had no issues what so ever and some that have had minor issues that you get with all manufacturers now days, sorted with software update. Don’t know why but it seems most issues are coming from USA.I have had my Trefeo for nearly two months and have had no issues whatsoever, I’m delighted with my purchase and have no regrets at all, fantastic car all round.Stand by for the die hard drum players I’m sure they will be on your post very soon.Good luck which ever way you go with purchase.Click to expand...',\n",
       " \"Umze said:I got a Modena some weeks ago. Fantastic car. I will come back to this.. No software issues really You need to tinker with options to your liking though, invest some free time t do it. I wished Android Auto reflected on the front HUD or Headsup but the main screen is big and ok. Wireless android or carplay works very nice. 2 phones could be connected at the same time. Cooling and AC works perfect, my preference is gentle fan. Cooling seasts work perfect in fact your butt could be cooled way more than intended and you are forced to turn off , which is a good thing in hot summer days. I have laminated glass (very recommended) silent driving. When pedalled only engine noise which is desired anyway. 840 Watt Premium sound system is very adequate, best I have had actually but I would go for 1200+watt High Premium as it has even a better bass system independently configurable. I don't have driving assistance packages advance matrix headlights, don't miss that feature!!!! You may find many comments in this forum thereabout. Air suspension is a must have!! First you can lower or alter height on demand, you have offroad driving mode, you may select the car to drop at the lowest at exit and enter at this s setting(I don't use it but anyway it is there), if you speed, car goes into Aero 2 mode after certain km/mile which is quite low and assists top speed, air suspension handles bumps better than GT standard passive shocks, even better than active shocks standard in Modena. By the way don't just go to GT. Modena has so many features by default and a more powerful car. Limited Mechanical Slip Differential is standard on Modena not on GT. Modena has a wider back, 295 back tyres, car shape closer to Trofeo. I speeded a couple of times and BMW new 5 series which are fast cars couldn't catch me, almost instantly got over 200Km. And this is not Trofeo. Heads up is nice but I think navigation on headsup is distracting. You have to turn the car off to get rid of it once you started. I only use Android Auto. Get Full Chevron leather package, it is worth. Carbon fiber copper yearn front console looks weird, seen in another Modena. Carbon fiber or piano black front console is nice enough IMO. General quality is posh and very nice, maybe some bright plastic buttons here and there. Car is spacey front and back. Adequate boot. Surround camera is practical but camera resolution is awful compared to other things and the infotainment system in the car. How the hell they chose it I have no idea. Ok.. drive-wise, really nice, sport mode makes the car alive, and very firm on the road but you can choose softer suspension even in sport mode. car inside lights become red in sport, nice..GT is the daily ride. very nice handling and taking the turns in general. Brakes could have been better, larger but it is ok as long as you don't race. This vehicle has a special stability module like many Porsches. Ohhh, dont get 20 inch wheels, please. 21 inches Crio or Pegasus wheels fit perfect to this car. They dont look big and reduces comfort IMO with air suspension. I have 21 inch Crio. One last thing, I couldn't have some options with my car due to practical reasons. If had the finances, go for all the major options, especially driving assistance packages and High Premium sound system, and all comfort options and go for Modena at the very least. I had to pay over €250k for my Modena due to exorbitant taxes otherwise I would have gone for a Trofeo for sure and save some money for MC20 in EU or USA or similarHope to have contributed your decision.

Something that sits a bit higher, has a bit more interior space, but also has an increase of goodies, flare, style, and luxury.So I took a quick look at the upcoming Grecale and after maybe 45 minutes of being really surprised by everything I saw, I decided to put down a deposit on the LE Modena--something I've never done before!I'm definitely hoping for a Blu Intenso/Red color combo.View attachment 171It just really seems to check a lot of boxes, fits my budget, and I really like my local Maserati/Alfa Romeo dealer.

       " 'Read this with interest as I replaced a Giulia Quadrifoglio last year with a (new) F-Pace SVR - one of the prime rivals the article cites, and interestingly I found and commented on the Stelvio Vs SVR thread only yesterday - https://www.pistonheads.com/gassing/topic.asp?h=0&...I’ve only seen two Grecale in the flesh, neither the Trofeo obviously, and it’s actually better looking than the pictures foretell, but it’s also not overly distinctive, although perhaps appropriately so for a Maserati.Dropping the new 530bhp Maserati V6 into this car makes for an alluring proposition and had the ingredients to fight with the best. The article even gives the impression that it succeeds to a good level, as whilst it plays second fiddle to the hottest Macan and F-Pace SVR in two specific areas, they also cite that they are high bars to reach, and that the Maserati betters the others in the segment.The one glaring issue is its price point. I bought my SVR last September, brand new but a stock car. Its RRP was just under £88k with a decent level of options. I paid a smudge over £75k cash. What’s more, my car comes with (either standard or the optional extras fitted) all of the £8k of options the test car has, plus more, although with the exception of full matrix LED headlight (I have standard LEDs).I’m sure there will be wriggle room in the Maserati’s price, but the optioned car is over £30k more than I paid and £20k over RRP. Hell of a premium for a Maserati.But, whilst I’m sure the notion of 500bhp+ smaller SUVs makes the blood boil of the driving supremos on here, but as an actual customer in that market, combining entertainment with the practicality medium sized SUVs offers is a welcome market development.

The thing that I’m trying to get my head around is the spec regarding boot storage. On my old Q5 I had a net in the right handrecess.Thisis missing from the new car and as far as I can work out, the storage pack upgrade only references a left hand side recess net, implying the right hand side should be a standard fit.Its obviously a minor thing, and possibly even a little petty but we used to keep our shopping bags in it and the first aid kit, these are now rattling around in the compartment underneath.Can anyone confirm if the standard model Q5 should have come with this feature?Many thanks.',\n",

BMW told me this how they determined which vehicle received a higher top speed.Since I have a heavy foot, I went with the 20\" wheels to ensure my X3M40i would be given a top speed of 155mph. Otherwise I would have been given a 130mph top speed had I chosen the 19\" all weather tire.Click to expand...I think you forgot to mention that in the US, BMW also equips with \"summer\" W-rated tires for 19\" wheels (this is what I have and with increased top speed limiter), which is the Bridgestone Alenza 001.

I found how to switch this in the settings, made the switch, and all was good. Then I stopped into a store, came out and the speedo was back in KPH. Did I miss something in setting this preference?

I took the vehicle to the dealer and they lubricated the parts in the steering wheel after removing the airbag and put it back together and it was still making the sound. They then removed the parts again, lubricated and replaced the clock spring. There was no indication of a clock spring failure because all of the components in the steering wheel were working and I had no failure alerts. Here we are a month later and the steering wheel is making the noise again. The dealer said I can bring it back in for them to lubricate but it’s more of a nuisance and will not cause any type of issue with the steering wheel or components on the steering wheel. I’m a little nervous, or let’s just say I’m OCD when it comes to noises on a car that only has 11,000 miles on it. Has anyone experienced the same issue? I would love to hear from you.

I imagine if I changed out the rft 19 with non rft it would have improved the ride quality. I recall checking the monitor on tire pressure and it didn’t raise any flags but can’t recall exactly. I did have the adaptive suspension. These things may have helped with the ride but not sure about the connectivity to the road. I completely get the $20k in cost you pay to get that feel as I just forked it out (ouch).For $ reference I paid $63k and traded for $59k (could have sold for $63k pp but local tax laws washed that out). New build was $83k.\",\n",

Here are a few thoughts on some of the vehicles I’ve owned:-TSX was peppy, economical, well built-First 335i was a dream, fast, raw, solid-Infiniti was smooth yet sporty, refined-M2, tried to relive ‘07 335i, fell short-First Porsche/SUV, impeccable, groundedMacan S vs BMW X3 M40i (lived this 2x)On paper X3 was the logical choice.faster, better tech, fuel efficient, valueBefore purchasing my first Macan, I test drove X3 and Macan b2b several times.I asked the Porsche sales rep why the hell I’d pay a premium for such an inferior value. He simply replied, “take it for a test drive”. Then I put my foot in mouth.The difference was night/day.With Macan I was truly connected to the road, it felt solid/confident, the interior quality was impeccable, the balance between agility and comfort was out of this world. I did find the X3 to be fast and fun (just different).Unfortunately I sold my first Macan as I was paying $500/m to park and I wasn’t driving during COVID. More recently I moved and bought a condo so thought I’d save $/gas and ordered an x3M40i (without test driving). To be candid, it felt like a fast, bumpy, plastic box on wheels. Ended up trading it in for the 2023 Macan S before I even filled up the gas tank. Gulp. Given my deep experiences with both brands, I hope you can appreciate the lack of bias in my personal experience. I recognize for many the x3 just offers way too much value to pass on…I couldn’t be more excited to get back in a new Macan S. Now faster, and I added air suspension.

       " 'avinashgautam said:Hello fellow Bimmers,I come here to this group to share my experience with Bimmer-Tech sound system products that I recently bought for my X3 G01. I wish to share this with you because when I first began looking for a sound system upgrade in the fall of 2020, I could not find conversation from anyone who had installed the entire kit. I hope that insight from me can help my fellow bimmers make better decisions.They have a range of combinations to choose from. I went for top of the class set, bought an Alpha One Studio Sound Complete Speaker Set and a Premium Sound System amplifier. I have not gone into detailed technicalities of entire process but will be happy to guide based on my experience.Studio Sound – Alpha One Complete Speaker SetI recently bought an US X3 G01 series base model which had basic S676A HiFi basic sound system. I am a serious audiophile, and I wanted my car to sound good but the moment I turned up the volume, I was disappointed to the core. I wondered why such a luxury brand car would sound just ok, even my ex-Honda was beyond better. Within one ride I decided that I needed an upgrade. I started searching the internet for a solution and then Bimmer-Tech, a brand name that echoed as an elite life savior for many BMW owners, emerged. They had launched their Studio Sound Alpha One speaker set along with a customizable amplifier Premium Audio System. Reading through the product, I could get a clear picture as to what is under the hood since the specifications were clearly listed. I liked their introductory videos on the product which gave me confidence to buy. Now there are other players in the market with lucrative deals, however, there is catch – You will either not know what the specs are, or you will have to cut some wires and get it all setup. I talked to many local car stereo shops and other players, but no one could convince me like Bimmer-Tech.I ordered the Studio Sound Alpha One speaker set and Premium Audio System amplifier. Yes, I recommend you get the amplifier for sure. Even without the amplifier, the speaker set is super awesome and transforms audio in your car but at the same time, being an audiophile, I realized that it shows how weak the factory amplifier is. You will get a feeling that there is more that can come out, but the factory amplifier won’t just do it. Coming back, I got the delivery within 5 days of placing the order. The packaging is premium and had feel-good feeling to it, you will appreciate that you ordered a premium product for your luxury car. Installation video was not available for my car, but Bimmer-Tech prepared an instruction document for me quickly and sent it over before the product arrived.I started with the center dash, was a quick and easy plug and play installation after which I just gave a song a try. My Oh My! The sound just changed with one center dash set. I could notice the difference. I quickly went for the front doors and tested a song again. The front of the car - the cockpit had transformed into this new sound arena. In no time, I jumped to rear speaker set and voila, the old damping dull BMW sound had gone. My car became alive. Point to note here is when I just changed one speaker set, I could notice the sound difference. So, for those who are not willing to buy complete set, Bimmer-Tech recommends doing it in stages. My personal recommendation would be to do driver’s choice set first. The build quality of the speaker is super solid, sturdy and premium. When you hold them in your hand, you will yourself notice that this is no ordinary product in your hands, the make and manufacture clearly give you an insight as to how awesome they will play your music.Premium Audio System – PP86My Alpha One Complete Speaker Set had rocked my car by transforming it into a new sound arena. I was enjoying music way better than factory speakers; however, I was having this feeling that there is more than can be done. Something is stopping that sound power to not flow. I began installation of my Premium Audio System amplifier which took not more than 45 minutes. It had come pre-loaded with custom tuned file for my car. When I turned it up, I could immediately notice a change in power. The sound was rich, it wanted to travel with all that power. It was like something had just opened the door to a charging horse in a racetrack. This experience was above and beyond of what native speakers and especially the amplifiers had to offer. For the first time, I felt the bass under my car seat. It was punching me, telling me that I am here to rock your world. I was happy and wanted to take things to another level.I reached out to Bimmer-Tech and got introduced to Maciej, who a sound specialist (among other things), understood the sound I was looking and started working with me on a tuning file best suited for my taste. This is where Bimmer-Tech is exceptionally good in customer service, they take things to next level. I got a call from Maciej and was literally interviewed of what kind of sound I like. In a few calls and email conversations, Maciej provided me a tuning file that took my sound experience to a whole new amazing level. Maciej from Bimmer-Tech had created a sound plane for me in my driver seat where every speaker of the car was pumping balanced audio to my ears. It was like that the music was right in front of my ears and I could just hear it.We didn’t stop here, we went ahead and started replicating the sound experience of the driver seat to every other seat in the car. I was surprised to see the customization of the amplifier. Bimmer-Tech provides you with a software and a detailed user guide. Basically, you don’t even need to wait for Bimmer-Tech to help, you can yourselves customize the tuning file real time. However, you can ask for their help and they will never cease to amaze you. If you have a X3 G01 like me, ask for the tuning files they had prepared for me and you will like it.So, after a 50+ emails, 10+ tuning file samples and 1 working session, I finally have the sound that I desire in my car. The customization of the Premium Audio System amplifier combined with their Alpha One Studio Sound Speaker set is a perfect way to transform audio in your BMW. I seriously think that Bimmer-Tech should partner with BMW and teach them a thing or two on car sound.This journey with Bimmer-Tech has been amazing and it has made me their permanent customer for my X3. I have already purchased a few other products from them.To ConcludeWent for top of the class set, bought an Alpha One Studio Sound Complete Speaker Set and a Premium Sound System amplifier from Bimmer-Tech.

I paid some $899 for Amplifier and $1298 for the kit. Got a trim tool kit for ~$15 or less. T50 torx bit , 3/8 Drive Socket set ~$50 etc. The best way to plan is to read the installation guide and see what is needed for the car.',\n",

I wish to share this with you because when I first began looking for a sound system upgrade in the fall of 2020, I could not find conversation from anyone who had installed the entire kit. I hope that insight from me can help my fellow bimmers make better decisions.They have a range of combinations to choose from. I went for top of the class set, bought an Alpha One Studio Sound Complete Speaker Set and a Premium Sound System amplifier. I have not gone into detailed technicalities of entire process but will be happy to guide based on my experience.Studio Sound – Alpha One Complete Speaker SetI recently bought an US X3 G01 series base model which had basic S676A HiFi basic sound system. I am a serious audiophile, and I wanted my car to sound good but the moment I turned up the volume, I was disappointed to the core. I wondered why such a luxury brand car would sound just ok, even my ex-Honda was beyond better. Within one ride I decided that I needed an upgrade. I started searching the internet for a solution and then Bimmer-Tech, a brand name that echoed as an elite life savior for many BMW owners, emerged. They had launched their Studio Sound Alpha One speaker set along with a customizable amplifier Premium Audio System. Reading through the product, I could get a clear picture as to what is under the hood since the specifications were clearly listed. I liked their introductory videos on the product which gave me confidence to buy. Now there are other players in the market with lucrative deals, however, there is catch – You will either not know what the specs are, or you will have to cut some wires and get it all setup. I talked to many local car stereo shops and other players, but no one could convince me like Bimmer-Tech.I ordered the Studio Sound Alpha One speaker set and Premium Audio System amplifier. Yes, I recommend you get the amplifier for sure. Even without the amplifier, the speaker set is super awesome and transforms audio in your car but at the same time, being an audiophile, I realized that it shows how weak the factory amplifier is. You will get a feeling that there is more that can come out, but the factory amplifier won’t just do it. Coming back, I got the delivery within 5 days of placing the order. The packaging is premium and had feel-good feeling to it, you will appreciate that you ordered a premium product for your luxury car. Installation video was not available for my car, but Bimmer-Tech prepared an instruction document for me quickly and sent it over before the product arrived.I started with the center dash, was a quick and easy plug and play installation after which I just gave a song a try. My Oh My! The sound just changed with one center dash set. I could notice the difference. I quickly went for the front doors and tested a song again. The front of the car - the cockpit had transformed into this new sound arena. In no time, I jumped to rear speaker set and voila, the old damping dull BMW sound had gone. My car became alive. Point to note here is when I just changed one speaker set, I could notice the sound difference. So, for those who are not willing to buy complete set, Bimmer-Tech recommends doing it in stages. My personal recommendation would be to do driver’s choice set first. The build quality of the speaker is super solid, sturdy and premium.

I was enjoying music way better than factory speakers; however, I was having this feeling that there is more than can be done. Something is stopping that sound power to not flow. I began installation of my Premium Audio System amplifier which took not more than 45 minutes. It had come pre-loaded with custom tuned file for my car.

       " \"avinashgautam said:Hey Buddy, I just happened to visit a local car stereo shop in California yesterday and this Alpha one set is a known name and a recommended one. I just happen to ask car stereo shop owners, every now and then, about bimmertech sound products to satisfy myself that my decision was right. Honestly, this is the only 2nd shop I had visited for some dashcam work. However, yes if you want to choose other options at the store, everyone is happy to customize and fit your budget. I too had done this comparison before going for Alpha One. For there complete set price bracket, I chose individual components online like speakers, tweeters, wiring, subs, amps and could find similar or higher configs within the same or a little less range. Yeah, as I went higher looking for configs I found more options and saw that by spending another 500 bucks I could double the sound. I even had this vague idea of getting trying some company and sending them the product back. So why alpha one after all this?1. First , I could not find any amp that is highly customizable like the one in Alpha One set. Bimmertech worked with me live remotely and tuned the sound for me in my car. I have 3 to 4 config files from them that suit my various sound needs. Ask them for some preconfigured g01 customer files and they will be happy to share. So,I have a surround one that attempts to give equal sound experience to every passenger in the car and then I have another one that pumps all sound to me in my driverseat.Ondays when I will be driving alone I choose to change. Also, I do have kids sometimes in the car and I can just turn off speakers on their side. Its just awesome because I can still play loud enough music without doing anything damaging to the kids ears2. There speakers come preconfigured for bmws. The size fits the spacing perfectly. The speaker size of bmw is small compared to other brands and there casing to hold the speaker too is small. When I was shopping online I couldn't find bmw sized speakers, they were of regular size and a lot of cutting and then aound proofing the space would be needed to fit a market product.3. Plug and play was another thing. I did not cut any wires but was just connecting the cables like you put usb into usb drive.All of this made mecrealise that its better to fit a product that is sized for bmw and configured for your car vin.I am also eager to read what other enthusiasts have to say.Click to expand...hi is that brand for sale in Europe?\",\n",

Since my recent purchase was under the CPO warranty, I was able to capture a video of the intermittent noise (describing as a flute or tea pot steaming sound) and shared it with the Service Advisor at United BMW in Atlanta.

Generally it can be heard really well when driving about 20mph on a side street with no radio on. To me it sounded like a bad fan bearing, which I knew from my old e83 X3, so I suggested this and the SA agreed and they replaced the fan unit, but the noise is still there.

It was just enough to get us wanting to do the full M school. Each driver got two laps per car. My wife was a little frustrated because she kept coming close to lapping the car in front of her so they had to slow her down a lot to keep the gaps.

The Michelins wear evenly with less pressure than the Continentals. I\\'d go with the Michelin PS A/S 4\\'s as my first choice. My second choice would be the Bridgestone Potenzas. Both of these tires have an \"AA\" traction rating which measures wet traction of a tire.All those tires are non-run-flats. They\\'ll ride better than run-flats. Hopefully, your X3 has the optional spare tire.Bridgestone also has the Dueler H/T Sport AS in that size. That\\'s what came on Frau Putzer\\'s 2018 X3 30i. They\\'re an \"touring\" tire, which is a nice way of saying low-performance. The one advantage they have over the other tires is that they\\'re symmetric. There\\'s no inside our outside sidewall. After 35k miles, Frau Putzer\\'s tires had an average of 0.5/32\" more wear in the outside circumferential than in the inside channel. So, for $219, I had them flipped on the wheels and rebalanced. That will get her at least an extra 10k miles out of the tires, for a total of somewhere between 60k and 70k miles.. I make an effort to drive the X3 instead of my 535i as much as possible, so that the X3\\'s tires will wear out before they age out (six years).The Bridgestone Dueler H/T Sport AS\\'s are available in both run-flat and non-run flat. Frau Putzer\\'s X3 has the non-run-flat version.I suspect the Pirelli P7\\'s on your X3 are run-flats. It doesn\\'t look like Pirelli makes a non-run-flat P7 tire in that size.Tire rotation is not part of required maintenance. But doing so will extend the life of your tires, and will benefit the transfer case clutches if you have xDrive. Even with xDrive, the correct rotation pattern is the RWD one:LF > RR > RF > LR > LFThat\\'s because most of the power (60%) still goes to the rear axle.Click to expand...I rotate my tires every oil change at 7500 miles.

The used car is in really good condition and it's coming from a friend so I'm not too worried about any issues incurred by its previous use, the only reason they're selling it is because they want to go electric and have a bit too much money to spend. I'd probably plan on keeping the car until the 5-year guarantee runs out, after that, I'd sell it or trade-in for a new model depending on what's on the market at the time. I'm guessing after 5 years the difference between the 2021 and 2022 will be between $1250-2500.You're totally right about the spare tire, I didn't check for that but I should, where I live it's quite remote so getting flat would be a real nightmare even with the run-flat tires. This could be a real deal-breaker now that I think about it. I'm also not a fan of the colors on the 2021 I've been offered and I just love the facelift that 2022 has been given.If the 2021 doesn't have the spare tire and given the potential loss in resale, the gap could be closer to $6500 instead of $10,000.Click to expand...You could offer them less. Keep in mind, that in most states (definitely not California), a trade in reduces the amount of sales tax paid. As an example, if you’re trading in a $35,000 car, in a 7% sales tax state, that’s $2,350 sales tax not charged. Yes, there are exceptions and various other rules which may apply, but you get the concept. So, your friends may not have room to budge. You also loose warranty sooner (than if you bought new).

This data is given in road tests of vehicles in car magazines (Car and Driver, Road & Track, Motor Trend, etc.).Here\\'s the first catch. Weight put behind the rear axle will actually amplify the weight placed on the rear axle. It will also remove some weight from the front axle. You\\'d have to do a weight and balance calculation to determine the maximum weight you can carry in the cargo area. (I might mess with this tomorrow.)The second catch is that you have to worry about damaging the removable floor of the cargo area, particularly if you have a hybrid or have a spare tire. The way to mitigate this risk is to cut a piece of plywood about the size of the cargo area floor. That will spread the weight of the cargo more evenly over the removable floor.Click to expand...Yes, I had taken care of the \"cardboard\" floor in the cargo area and was just wondering about the weight. However, I think the towing tongue weight gives me my answer. If you can have a tongue weight of 500 lbs., then you should be able to put 300 lbs. of cargo in the rear cargo area with no problem.

That being said many improvements have been made to address previous “issues” including beefy starters, arc sprayed cylinder wall liners to combat start/stops and fully closed deck design. I have only seen 1 B46D replaced in a BMW since they were released and it was due to repeated overheats as an enterprise car. Mini replaced many when the engine first came out for a missing thrust bearing…yup missing. When stepping on the clutch customers were moving the crankshaft 😳. Since most of the bugs were worked out in Mini it’s been very reliable in BMW brand.

So, if you need to buy then you need to buy. It is what it is...I\\'m also on my first BMW and I\\'m fairly happy with the car. Have had it for 2 years now and it still keeps a smile on my face. So far, the \"costs\" of dealing with the car have all been a lot lower than my Mercedes I sold before buying the BMW so both me and the better half are happy!Financial decisions are complex, but in this market I would say put down as little as you\\'re comfortable with monthly payment wise. Get a loan term that is reasonably long, like 5 years, depending on interest rates for you. Invest the rest of the downpayment and enjoy the cheaper TCO as a result. Car prices are up like crazy so you can likely skip GAP insurance too as I doubt there is going to be a gap (or much of one) and since you\\'re well capitalized anyway it won\\'t matter. If you just can\\'t stand having a payment though then you can approach it differently, of course.Personally, I\\'m not a fan of leasing. I\\'ve never done it and I just don\\'t really like the concept all that much. It is a longterm rental so you\\'ll end up perpetually paying the depreciation curve on new cars which is where the money really is lost on car purchases. IMHO, buy it and sell it or trade it when you\\'re done and you\\'ll end up better off with less \"hassle\" unless you really want to be on that treadmill.Reliability and maintenance wise will depend a fair bit on your preferences. If you prefer to go to the dealer for all your work like I do then it is likely a better deal to get an extended warranty and extended maintenance plan depending on how long you plan to keep the vehicle. I skipped this on my Mercedes and I noticed that maintenance costs went up at dealers after the new car warranty expires. I expected the same for BMW so extended my maintenance but I will own for 7Y and hope to put least 100K by then.Let\\'s not forget the span that driver was dealing with was 300 miles...I wouldn\\'t drive 300 miles on a donut spare... If you get a blowout on that donut spare you\\'re back at square 1.RFT are more resistant to blowouts and you\\'re more likely to encounter a slow leak that you can nurse along until you get to your destination if you have a pump in your trunk..I\\'m very happy with RFTs and I\\'ve down over 22K miles on mine... I enjoy doing overnight 1K mile+ drives too so very risky from that perspective, but I don\\'t bat an eye...Click to expand...There\\'s no specific mileage limit on donut spares. There\\'s a 50 MPH / 80km/h speed limit on them, but there are usually old surface highways paralleling interstates.

My luck ran out on the return leg, and my MPG for the round-trip was \"only\"37.6.In addition to hyper-mile-ing and using EcoPro, my other \"tricks\" are that I ordered the X3 with non-run-flat tires.

I found this thread at the weekend so thanks for the original poster and other contributors, not the idiots saying how people should not be touching buttons and leave it all on AUTO, etc.My girlfriends MY2020 Macan Turbo has been blowing out hot air.  This is with AC off, SYNC on and both sides set to LOW.Clearly the car was heating the air somehow.Took the car to our local OPC and after trying to fob us off that the AC should be on, demanded to see a technician who came out and stated it was not correct.Took the car into the workshop, plugged on diagnostic and no faults.Got in another 2020 Macan Turbo in car park and it did  the same.  Temp set to LOW but air coming out of vents clearly way hotter than atmospheric air temperature.Then got in a 2023 GTS demonstrator with the same 2.9 V6 engine and the piano panel centre console and guess what - it does the same.Car booked into OPC for 3 weeks time for them to look at it, however this evening we have been digging around and doing some testing and found the issue.Under the Settings menu, under the instrument cluster, there is an option for AIR CON\\\\AUTO RECIRC which was ticked.I assume this means the RECIRC button in the climate control physical button panel does nothing and is over-ridden by this setting being on.  Therefore although the RECIRC light comes on and off when you press the button, this is fully or mostly ornamental and does nothing because the car is controlling the RECIRC by the AUTO RECIRC setting.Switched AUTO RECIRC setting off and the car now vents atmospheric temperature air with the AC off - NO MORE HOT AIR!!I assume the AUTO RECIRC setting is agnostic of the A/C button status, which is arguably stupid.  It is therefore looking at the extremely hot cabin temperature and recircing to try and reduce the cabin temperature ASAP as would be effective IF THE AC WAS SWITCHED ON and essentially getting into a doom loop.Hope this helps some people.',\n",

       " \"Got invited by Porsche centre Teesside to test drive the Taycan, and enjoy an afternoon tea at a very nice hotel.I've been sceptical of EV's from the start, so was expecting to hate the drive. But thought it'd be interesting to have a go and keep an open mind. The Taycan itself looks pretty good. Certainly one of the best looking EV's on sale today.I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised. Not what I was expecting. The ride quality was excellent, but being a Porsche I did expect that. The silence and lack of engine noise did feel strange, and have to say, without the radio on, you do hear a lot of tire noise and wind noise. Having the radio on, which most of us will have on most of the time, then it was less noticeable.  Sport plus mode brought some noise which improved things, but still no substitute for a proper engine noiseThe bits I didn't like, was the controls. The lower centre screen was ok. Yes everything is just a screen with haptic buttons, but worked pretty well. The sat-nav screen wasn't as easy to use as in the Macan. But the thing I hated the most was the controls for the lights being haptic buttons on the screen behind the steering wheel. I just don't see the point. Hard to press when the car moving around on the road, so eyes are taken away rather the reaching down for a toggle switch. I guess most people will just leave in auto-mode.The thing I was most impressed by was the acceleration. Any small gaps in traffic, and you're never out of revs, off boost, or waiting for the gearbox to downshift. It made overtaking a split second decision, and thus making progress really easy. I did notice that I was always on the brakes. When cars in front lift off, there is obviously no engine braking, so you're constantly on the brakes when you wouldn't normally be. I expect disc and pad wear to be far greater on EV's compared to ICE cars.The range. On collection it was stating 228 miles, and I was assumed it was fully charged. So I'm assuming the demo cars get driven pretty hard, as I was expecting to see better range than that. Considering my Macan shows up with around 390 miles of range on it's 75l fuel tank. Though TBH, it's not been driven that hard yet.So my conclusion? I was very impressed, and have more respect for EV's than I did before. While it was undoubtedly quick due to the instant power on tap, it did feel just a bit remote compared to an ICE car. Could I live with one? For most of my journeys, yes, it would suit our needs. But for longer trips to Scotland and wales, then maybe not. Not unless you plan trips and hope the charging stations are working that day, and no queue's waiting for them. I still think the infrastructure needs to be rapidly improved. There is one charge port in a car park in Grassmere, and every time I've been there the same car is plugged into the charge port several hours later. So selfish drivers, plugging in, and go off for a days walking, leaving anyone else needing it, stranded.If manufacturers can make EV feel more ICE like, then maybe the future of EV's might not be that bad, infrastructure allowing. But for now, I'll stick to Petrol, and all the benefits, it brings over EV's. But maybe Hydrogen is the answer to get the benefits of both? No charging, and fill up in minutes. Or synthetic fuels. No charging, fill up in minutes, use the millions of existing cars already on our roads, so no scrapping of perfectly good cars. Unfortunately most investment money is being spent on EV's. More need spending on the alternatives. Then we could have several types of cars on our roads benefiting what type of car suits each individual, rather than legislative for EV which a for a lot of people just won't be a viable option.\",\n",

Most charging is at home. I have used very little public charging. Never visit a petrol station, which can only be good. And recent fall in electricity rates with overnight charging costs about 3p/mile or a bit less when charging at home.Obviously they aren't for everyone - I fully accept that. If you drive 200+ miles on a regular basis with no charging at the other end before you come back (or even 120 miles then back the same day) then stick to ICE - definitely. But if you don't often drive that sort of distance, the improved driving dynamics make for a much better experience every time you go out.  And as MCDK says above, they are so fast. A Macan seems slow and unresponsive by comparison (sorry, but this is the case - I had a GTS loaner for a day and even that seemed pedestrian).It looks like you had the rear wheel drive version... is that correct? It probably seemed quick compared to your Macan, but is the slowest Taycan. However it probably seems fast because of the instant torque available.Interesting development recently about eco fuels and the EU pushing back the deadline for no new ICE. We will see what happens!

The problem is when the batteries do give up the ghost, the car is an instant write off due to cost of replacement. This means second owners are in danger of owning a practically worthless car even with 60k miles on the clock, even though the batteries may last longer than 80k miles - who would pay more than tuppence ha’penny to find out??This is contributing to EV used values among other things - these cars have got to come down in price to be viable on the used market not to mention the depreciation to the new private buyer?',\n",

I started with a 4S and at the time there was a massive chip shortage then the waits went up to >1 year so I put down a deposit on a second one. Couldn't get a 4S in a sensible timescale so ordered a Turbo. My thinking was that there would be little or no depreciation. I was correct - only 5k in 10 months. Now of course is a different story and my current plan is to keep the Turbo for a long time. Bought through a limited company so the depreciation is tax free. Over 5-6 years it will still be a lot of money but more palatable than a short term exchange at the moment.My heater works fine although I accept it could pack up. As per the loaner described, my screens occasionally go blank and re-boot. In the past it has periodically forgotten my radio favourites but that bug seems to have been sorted now. There are a few quirks, but so far nothing has stopped it driving. The 4S did spend some time getting a communication issue sorted out. I think it eventually had an electronic bit unplugged to reset it.Both cars have been fantastic to drive. If you spend some time on the Taycan forum you will see that the RWD is probably software limited and a lot slower than the others. The 4S drops the 0-62 down to 4 seconds (I think RWD is 5.4) and Turbo down to 3.2.Currently the 4S I sold has caught up the depreciation I never had and the difference between my old 4S and the Turbo remains the same as the difference between the new purchase prices (Autotrader figures). I suspect this is because I had to add £15k extras to the 4S but only £5k to the Turbo to get the same spec due to the standard Turbo spec being higher. Also got various extras that I didn't spec on the 4S. Like warp speed accelerationI have to say that the cars are just awesome to drive. They are not going to handle as well as a 911 due to their weight, but the responsiveness is like driving around with the sport response button pressed all of the time. And when you want it to go, it really goes.I do think that the whole electric thing is not quite ready for everyone yet, but since I do relatively few long journeys and have charging at home it is great for my use. The 4 seats are good as I can take people in the car easily. I recently went to Liverpool for a meeting - 3 of us went up and stayed for a few days and 4 came back in the car, no problems. There were strict instructions to limit luggage size though!Now I have moved to a night time EV tariff the charging costs have dropped to ~3p/mile and it is easy to plug in at home. My charger is set to connect overnight and it works well.I have no regrets buying either Taycan. If you think the electric could work for you then there are probably quite a lot of 1-2 year old cars around at a very good price. I doubt you would regret it!\",\n",

I have admired Taycans for some time and have driven one and loved it!My circumstances are similar to yours so running costs and ease of use will not be a problem - where we differ is that I would be a private buyer and depreciation will play a part as I doubt it would be particularly long term.My only other concern is that it has a great party trick with its acceleration but lacks a little “soul” or drama at least for me.Having said all that I think they look great and the interior is a fabulous place to be so swings and roundabouts.Still probably best EV around and that’s saying something given how many get launched weekly it would seem',\n",

Although I’m still running in, it also feels livelier than the last, can’t believe this is all down to the GTS package add on which the last one didn’t have, but this one feels more GTS than the last. I need more time behind the wheel but there’s definitely a performance difference. Handling feels a notch up as well, especially mid corner and pulling out of bends under throttle, no doubt PTV but also the super sticky Corsa’s.Am I back in love with the GTS? I think I am, didn’t realise how much I missed it until I got behind the wheel.

Lots more pops, burbles and rasp on gear change.I agree on the options especially the GTS, having had one without I’d say go for the drivers performance enhancing options, the GTS package actually represents good value for money (doesn’t sound right I know) racetex headlining is beautiful.

The Macan from fatcory only displays the CarPlay in a small window, I appreciate that the currrent Cayenne, Panamera, Taycan etc have all had more recent refreshes and use newer than PCM5 and are capable of full screen CarPlay in HD.

Happy to share more details as required as this is not a sales pitch - but from around $200 (US Dollars) the mod can be done quite quickly.Drop me a PM if you want to know more.

It will need to be freshly formatted and blank. Also a Windows laptop with Ethernet port, an ethernet cable and then a specific D-Link Ethernet to USB adapter (as Porsche is fussy on what works with it!) and a USB-A to USB-C adapter to plug in to the USB-1 in arm rest. You will need to be wirelessly connected to the internet and best that your laptop has an SD-Card slot too (mine didn't but worked around it). You will also need the latest Teamviewer software installed.Once plugged together and in contact by Facetime (disconnect your phone from car bluetooth first so you keep the video showing) he will transfer some files to your computer which will go on to the SD Card plugged in to your laptop. Then the SD-Card is removed and plugged in to the SD card slot in the car armrest.

I did end up getting a test drive on the Macan S for half an hour as I mentioned, and I’m not expecting some VIP treatment or anything but in this day and age everyone has busy lives and everyone’s time is valuable. I for one have turned up early on both occasions as to uphold my part of being considerate not wanting to waste the OPC/SE’s time either.First time, I know I might be making a bigger deal than it’s worth and being a Karen about it, but I think being made to wait over an hour (when it’s not even an unscheduled walk-in) with zero communication, and to top it all off to blame the receptionist shows there is no consideration on other people’s time. Also emailing me the second I left (probably a “oh shit, my commission just walked out the door”) was another point of annoyance as I was still in the car park or walking to the car park at the time, and had he called me instead I could have still walked back in. I’m one of those who’s not constantly glued to his phone, and having had nothing better to do than be on my phone for an hour, I didn’t think to check my email after I left and before I drove off.Regardless, I though maybe something did go wrong, and I’m overtly being sensitive, blaming the receptionist is major Yuk, but maybe there was something there, I decided to take the SE’s word for it and give the benefit of the doubt, second chance and whatnot and give it another go. I also admit the 48 hour test drive that was offered would have been a great way for me to compare the S and the GTS and also a chance for wife and kids to experience the car and give their feedback from their position in the car before we commit 80 grand.So made the journey back, but despite me virtue signalling about second chances, had it not been for the 48 hour offer, and if it was just that 30 minute test drive I would not have drove all that way in such a hurry nor would I have done it over a weekend either.Got there, second time was a bit better to begin with, he popped over (I was 10 minutes early) and introduced himself, shook my hand and said he will be 5 more minutes, to which I replied no problem take your time.But it went all down hill from there, firstly he reiterated the blame on the receptionists saying last time the receptionists simply forgot to inform him and that’s the honest truth and that they are normally better than that. And then comes the disappearing offer on test drive that I felt lied to, I might be wrong, but I feel like there never was an extended test drive on offer and it was just a way to get me to come back and spend my money with them, oh and one more thing I didn’t mention was the Head of new car sales also joined for a bit pushing me to place a deposit on the spot.Although I did go there with every intention to place my deposit and lock in my spot on the waiting list, I was never doing that after the second let down and being lied straight to my face until the evidence was there in black and white.So yes, the immature side of me did consider escalating this, and not just seek sympathy from fellow members here on this forum.But then I’m all for karma, paying it forward and all that. And do volunteer work when I can etc.Part of me feel like deserved or not, an escalation could be spiteful and not worth potentially ruining someone’s employment over when in the grand scheme of things it’s inconsequential and once I have my Macan in hand in the future, I would have probably forgot all about this already.So right now I’m leaning towards the direction of keeping it classy, forget and move on, find elsewhere to place my order, and just ignore all calls and emails from them going forward.P.S. I found it a little off putting when I was asked what do I do, and I told him the company I work for thinking that was that. And he asked again yes, but what is your title there? Felt that was a bit odd why he felt that was necessary info, and that little look I got… I guess a Director of XYZ is probably like a worm to them given who they probably normally deal with.Or maybe I’m just seeing everything through red tinted glasses after the sour experiences and biased.',\n",

But I think this might be the perfect build for me now and save the python green for a subsequent 911 instead.For those who followed my other thread, I guess this might be karma and if it does all work out as planned for a brand new GTS built on that September 2023 allocation, everything worked out in the most amazing fashion!-end of copy paste-\",\n",

I assume it's with another dealership then?Car specs are always a personal choice, so any comments would be purely personal taste ... but here we go !I'm not a fan of the alloys, and from personal experience, I can confirm a huge amount of brake dust comes off the brakes and onto the alloys. They will be a bitch to keep clean.I do like the black side blades on the doors, as it breaks up the doors and (for me) looks more sporty. I looked at the colour match on a Macan in the showroom, and in the flesh they look a bit naff, as they look fake. Would look far better if the doors could come without them totally. They look all after thought.I like roof bars as (to me) they add something to the styling. But it's money for something cosmetic only.I do also think White with White interior is a all White on the night, lol. But like I say, it's all personal taste.Pan Sunroof would brighten the interior up, but TBH I could have probably done without it myself.Smoking pack is worth the £33, as it's somewhere to keep keys etc in the car.If available, I'd tick BOSE, as slightly better sound over standard is always welcome with some good tunes on.If I could spec mine again, I'd go for the acoustic glass. I had this on my X3, and I can now feel the hot sunshine coming though on the Macan. But it's quite expensive at £1152.00.Can't see if you have ticked the 75l fuel tank, but well worth it if you haven't,Personally, I'd rather have a higher spec S than compromising on the GTS spec. But it just depends if this is a long termer, or just something for 2-3 years.But good luck getting your final spec locked in. September ain't far away !\",\n",

The 'standard' 8 way seats are in-fact GTS specific. I find them perfectly comfortable and very hugging but others wouldn't dare even sit in a Macan without the 14/18 ways.- I love my heated GT steering wheel, great option.- I find the ACC a useful addition and wouldn't be without it now.

In my situation, I just got lucky with the 1 email I sent to the 1 dealership to enquire about a used car they had and it transformed into a new car order.Regarding your thoughts, I do like the look of the satin black GT wheels the most and would pay extra for it, but it\\'s only available in combination with the GT sports package, and in lieu of that I thought I would just keep the standard 21\" Spyders in satin black.But maybe something to reconsider regarding washing and maintenance.Thanks for the info on the sideblades, I was going to get the gloss black sideblades, but thought for the same price get it body matched for a sleeker look, but didn\\'t realise it was plastic-looking, this does put it back on the table for debate, maybe I should go with the Gloss Black Package instead.Although the plan is to get this PPF\\'ed in a matte/satin PPF, to give the car a Satin white look to give it a touch of uniqueness so maybe it won\\'t matter in that case.Roof bars, I also ticked, but wife says it looks like a truck now, and hates it. Prefers the sleek look without, and I\\'m kind of indifferent so decided to go without.I did think some of the stuff makes it a bit sporty, but the final consensus was to keep this looking like a luxury suv/crossover, and just get a proper sporty car later instead (where we will be doing something more out there like python green or racing yellow, and do all the go-faster bits on that one and keep this one more of a SUV). I kind of agree with that actually, and I guess that\\'s also the missus hinting at approval to get a 911?Or so I hope.I did initially spec this is white with red interior, again missus hates the red (understandable as all red interior could be quite marmite) but loves the pebble grey, so white on white it is.......(not sure who\\'s car this is becoming now, but then again if a 911 is on the cards in the future, then I don\\'t mind it being so).Sunroof, I just heard of maintenance issues and leak issues, so I thought best to avoid the headache down the line.The smoking pack I avoided it because when selling one day, I didn\\'t want it to look like I have been smoking inside the car when we don\\'t even smoke. But good advice regarding somewhere to keep the keys, might take a look at this again.The demo car I test drove had BOSE and I must admit I was quite disappointed with the quality, maybe it hasn\\'t been broken it yet.

Price is only like £200 difference so it wasn't the main consideration for the decision.As for 14 way over 8 way, I wanted the seat ventilation and for that you can't get it on the 8 way.And resale, not really a concern (evident from the fact I was even considering python green), the only thing I considered about resale is if adding the smoker package as a non-smoker would give the wrong impression to buyers\",\n",

We’re also buying for the long term so as a general rule, if in doubt I will add to the spec rather than leave something out I think we’d like, albeit I have tried to set a notional limit on what we spend.On the 14 vs 18 ways, we have also specced ventilation but have 14 ways.  Our Gen 1 has 18 ways.  I find them a bit snug and the side bolster creasing is an issue.  But unless you are the exact same build as me, my opinion on seats is not relevant.Personally, I’m finding the combination of colour and some of the exterior items such as side blades, the gloss pack, door handles and wheels as the most difficult to decide on.  I really like the GT wheels and I’m leaning towards the standard side blades with the GT wheels in Satin Platinum and no other embellishments (except we have pano roof and roof bars).  Pebble interior is pretty much locked and we are thinking Gentian or Papaya as exterior colour.Ultimately I don’t think there is a wrong choice.  Good luck getting to the finishing line!',\n",

The new car is known as Jasper (Carrot) and is the brightest orange M4 you have ever seen with a (IMO) rather tasteless and very expensive full carbon BMW body kit.  It was sitting in our local Sytner showroom at full sticker price.Now my friend is a real car nut with a history of very interesting cars.  He is also far smarter than I am and a bit older (so really shouldn’t be driving a blinged up M4).However, on leaving the showroom from signing an order form for a new car for his wife, apparently he said to the SE casually, I might be interested in the M4 if you knock £10K off the price.The clever thing is the SE didn’t bite his hand off there and then - she waited a couple of days before calling back to confirm she had worked hard to secure the deal.At the time, I’d been considering an M3Touring instead of a Macan GTS so I had been watching M3, M4 and X3M prices and I am convinced he could have got another £10K+ off that particular car.But at the end of the day, I guess a car is worth what someone will pay.',\n",

       " 'I\\'ve had the Macan for about six weeks now and done about 1200 miles , so a few thoughts :-My original order for a new Macan \"T\" ( 2.0 litre) was White with 21\" alloys and a few other choice options. The ex demo Macan \"S\" I bought is Gentian Blue with 20\" alloys and £17k of options. Buying an ex-demo obviously gave me no choice on individual options but being “forced” to accept somebody else’s choices sometimes works in your favour.Colour- I still like a White Macan but the Gentian Blue with the aluminium highlights (and red calipers) looks great, a bit too bling for some, but the first comment I get from everybody is ,\"I love the colour\" . My previous two cars have been white and never had a problem with light scratches and swirls and small chips have always been easy to repair. Gentian Blue shows every little mark and swirl but does look stunning after it’s been cleaned. Would I actually spec it as a colour – on balance I think I would.Seats– My “T” spec had the 18 way seats and the “S” has 14 way , the 14 way are just as comfortable as the 18 way but the 14’s are easier to live with on a daily basis.Extended Leather- On my original spec, looks and feels great , gives the car that extra bit of class (s/be standard) Contrast stitching would make it look even better but not worth an extra £2500Wheels- 21\" alloys were always at the top of my list but the 20\" double 5 spoke (polished) would be my choice of wheel in hindsight. They\\'re easy to clean and I can actually clean the red calipers through the spokes. I cleaned my wife\\'s Juke yesterday , 19\" multispoke , took bloody ages to clean them.Engine- in my heart I always wanted the 2.9 V6 , as a car with a Porsche badge should have an engine to match , but a new one was about £5k over my budget. After 1200 miles with the “S” I think I would have been slightly underwhelmed with the “T”, my previous C250d had 205hp and a useful 500Nm of torque, floor it above 2000rpm and it just flew.375 bhp and a 0-60 in 4.7 seconds puts a big grin on my face every time I press hard with my right foot , it\\'s fast. It\\'s also so comfortable and quiet thanks to the air suspension and thermally insulated glass, even my grandson has commented on how quiet the car is , even though he\\'s glued to his iphone most of the time.MPG on a few 80 mile round trips has been about 31 mpg and 22mpg on the 8 mile school run, I only do about 7000 miles a year so can live those figures.Panoramic Roof( On my spec) - brightens up the interior no end and open is a lot less draughty than the one on my C Class - bigger wind deflector.Running boards- the general opinion was that they just got in the way when getting into the car so I decided not to spec them on the \"T\" , but very relieved that they\\'re fitted to the \"S\". I have a sit on kayak and there was always a question mark over whether I could transport it on the Macan, but the boards are brilliant , loading and strapping it to the roof rack is a dawdle. I can also clean the roof easily.Other fitted options:-Towbar - probably never use it.Adaptive cruise - don\\'t like it at all , cruise is fine but is sometimes overridden by the adaptive system PITA.Porsche crests on headrests -  I never notice them.Loadspace management system – useful on occasions but I wouldn’t spec it.Heated windscreen & steering wheel - car\\'s always parked in the garage , might be handy on the odd occasion.Silver tailpipes – look nice but I think £606 could be better spent elsewhere.Illuminated sill plates – look nice.Silver “Macan “S”  on sideblades – on Gentian , definitely.Thermally insulated glass +privacy glass. – The car is very quiet unless I’m pressing on, and very glad that it’s fitted , would I spend over £1000 to spec it – ask me when I order another Macan.One thing I have noticed , not sure if it’s because of the insulated glass, but the tint on the rear windows isn’t very dark, not a complaint, I have pretty grandchildren, but my neighbours new GLE’s tint is virtually opaque.Things I don\\'t like - having had column shift Mercedes autos for the past ten years I\\'m finding it hard to adapt to a centre console shift that doesn\\'t automatically set or release the handbrake . The useless speedometer, although I\\'m now used to looking at the digital speedo under the rev counter , easier to read actually.Things I really really like - The car , the engine , the ride - everything apart from the gearshift.Still can\\'t get over the fact that I got the \"S\" for slightly less than the cost of a new \"T\" and didn’t have to wait 12 months for delivery.Main omission – no spare wheel',\n",

       " \"Nice review. Yes Gentian Blue with silver roof bars, windows and tail pipes look great. I would say that though !!!!One option I wish I'd ticked was the thermally insulated glass. I had it on my X3 but didn't think it would be much different without. I was wrong. On a hot day, you can feel the heat coming through the windows, while on the X3 you didn't. Kicking myself over that one.18 way seats. I thought I'd F**ked up at first as I just couldn't get comfy and my back was aching even after just 30 min of driving. But now I've played about with them, I've found my comfy setting. I think slackening off the side bolsters helps a lot.

The loadspace management system is used on every supermarket shopping trip to stop the groceries flying everywhere, a loose tin of white emulsion in a Mk 1 Golf taught me the importance of securing loads, it took a long time clean up!

I went for the 18 ways seats. And although the seats feel more supporting that the 14 way seat I test drove, meaning they grip you tight feeling more bucket like, they did feel quite hard on my back. Few times my back ached, but that could be down to not having the right seating position yet. I have to say the driving position on my old X3 was superior in position to steering wheel / peddles. I'm still fiddling with the seat, but I do wish the steering column came out further than it does. Not much in the way of reach. Another inch would make getting a far better driving position.The peddles are taking some getting used to. Not sure why the brake peddle has to be further out than the throttle peddle. What feels great for one, is not right for the other. As I've seen this mostly in Audi's, I assume it's just because the Macan & Q5 are based on the same plantform. But surely this is an easy thing for Porsche to fix?Loving the overall look and feel of the interior. Feels a classy place to be. Though as with all modern cars, the infotainment system is frustrating in having to take your eyes off the road to prod the screen. But everything works well, nicely laid out. Will take some getting used to from BMW's I-Drive system.Burmester. It definitely sounds better than the BOSE system that was in the demo car I recently had for a few days. You can feel the difference in quality, especially in the base, and clarity of sound. Worth the £3500? Questionable, but I'm pleased I ticked it.Ride and handling. I think this is the biggest difference over say the X3 M40i. Once I did get on some open roads I know well, the ride quality over pretty poor roads was exceptional. Where in my GR-Yaris you wince over certain pot-marked surfaces, the Macan just flows over them. I guess that's the advantage of air suspension. I really was impressed.The other thing that impressed was the handling. For those who know the North. I went from Penrith to Alston to Middleton-in-Teesdale. A great twisty fast road. It really does feel unlike any other SUV I'd driven (again maybe air suspension) to the point the point where I found myself driving it like a Hot Hatch. Only when you catch a bump in corner at near 3 figures, are you reminded you're in a 1.8 tonne SUV. But very impressive for what it is.The engine. OK, I was taking it easy, but you can feel the power of that 2.9l V6. Overtaking was very easy without the need to rev it out. Kept below 4500 revs max for the first 500 miles. Wil then stretch it out between 500-1000 miles before full beans after that. Lots of low down torque to call upon. Think I'm going to like this engine.The brakes. Again, taking it easy, but maybe got carried away on the Penrith road. But they felt very strong without needing to lean on them too much. Feel far superior to those on the X3 which I always felt didn't like being pressed hard too often. One thing I've noticed is the amount of brake dust. Even on our first 50 mile drive out when we first picked it up. The wheels were covered in brake dust. I cleaned them before my day out, and the black left on both the sponge and my hands was quite shocking. Sponge still black, and it took a few washes to get my hands clean. Has anyone else found this?Hope the above wasn't too boring. But just thought I'd share my views. So much more of a car than I thought I'd be getting when I decided to look at the Macan 15 months ago.\",\n",

Now I never have to change them.I am not a fan of the 18 way, yes it does hold you firm and for me that resulted in back ache as there is no squirm room on long trips.Great road btw, used to ride over it frequently on the motorbikes.As for brake dust, that should lessen as the pads bed in but then a cleaning product like Getechniq’s Fall Out remover and a pressure washer will remove the vast majority of the brake dust.A sponge?

He advised the stages which I wrote earlier. First few hundred, load up but keep to about 4000-4500 revs, then between 500-1000 miles load up higher in the rev range. Just keep away from the red line.Right or wrong, who knows? But it came from an engineer rather that out of a handbook or salesman.

Really fill the arches and with air are not too rough.- ventilated seats. Have never had them before but absolutely love them. I run warm as a person but they are just so good for getting out of the car feeling fresh after a long journey.Thinks I had specced but now don’t have:- sports chrono. I have to push several buttons to tighten chassis, drop air and engage sport mode, rather than one. I don’t have sports plus but feel no need for this beyond what have. Probably wouldn’t spec this in future on anything other than a 911/boxster, as don’t feel need anymore sportiness than have and would spec the air instead.- race tex roof. The normal roof feels a little cheap in comparison.- PDLS plus. Would have liked the auto high beam and going to try and recode.- black roof rails, window trim and exhaust pipes. On the dark blue, not sure I need these and whether they would have perhaps made it look a bit more gangster. Some colours do need it, however.- don’t have extended leather. Would be nice to have on the dash, but it hasn’t changed world without - seats are full leather on the surfaces given 18 way and ventilated.In the round, I saved 8k and am super happy with the car.',\n",

I know I may be in a party of one here but i\\'ve never used it(apart from venting the car on hot days outside my office window).
